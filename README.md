## Planned Features

### Swipe/card style matching
- [] Pick/ban style UI
    - Maybe have left side be incoming cards, right be ones you swiped on?
    - Or both are ones you swiped on, bans at top like game UI
- [] Basic card which can be scrolled for more info
- [] And a place you cna click to open their full profile in a new tab
- [] Matching restricted to people you can actually duo with based on your rank

### Profile
- [] Display basic info from Riot API like IGN, rank, most played champs
- [] Age in "league years", whatever I decide that means
- [] Display recent match history
- [] Flavour Qs
- [] Last online indicator
- [] Languages spoken/preferred communication
- [] Discord/op.gg/other league profile linking
- [] Reputation
    - Can upvote for positive interactions
    - Possibly downvote for griefing/abuse but unsure on this
- [] Possibly a separate "like" system for funny/interesting profiles
- [] Highlight section?? Only if I can integrate it with the official replay system, letting people upload arbitrary clips sounds like an awful idea

### Window shopping mode
- To just check out people's profiles/make friends/demo when I have no users :'(
- Possibly disable matching/messaging in this mode to discourage smurfing? Make default behavior of swiping like/ignore instead
- [] Fill with satire profiles of LoL personalities?? 
    - maybe not legal/ethical
    - maybe if I make it reallllllly obvious satire
- [] Prioritize most liked profiles above other factors

### Search
- [] Server selector
- [] Filters
    - Rank
    - Role
    - Looking for...
    - Contact methods
    - Has flavour Qs
- [] Algorithm that learns from your preferences
    - [] Also de-prioritize people who've been inactive a while
- [] Challenge integration??
    - Like to find other people for the 5-man team comp challenges
    - Unsure if people other than me even care about that
    - Need to look into whether it's possible to get that data from API
    - [] Show challenges on profile
        - Completed and attempting sections

### Visuals
- [] Option to make your cursor the current/old style league cursor
- [] Light/dark mode toggle
- [] Animations on/off or low performance mode toggle

### Un-tilt me button
- [] Pet a poro to receive a randomly selected piece of wholesome league content
    - Stuff like miltfox animations

### Champion compatibility quiz
- [] Qs to find a champion you might like
    - By designer
    - By role
    - By play style
    - By theme

### Built-in messaging system
- Honestly might be better to just let people use discord/client but I should add this to prove I can
- [] Notifications when you have unread messages
- [] Inbox page
- [] Real-time messaging
- [] Typing indicator
- [] Custom LoL related emoji??
- [] Read indicator??

### Suggestion/Support Page
- Give people somewhere to ask for help/suggest new features/improvements/bugfixes
- [] Support request form
    - [] With dropdown for common requests
- [] Suggestion/bug fix box

### Donation page
- If this actually gets users the hosting might get expensive
- [] Some means of visualizing cost/how much $1 or some similar donation would help

### More efficient duo/team search
- Possible but unlikely, I think [op.gg's version](https://duo.op.gg/en) is just better for this
